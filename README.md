# ContactForm

Email and Password fields have their own validation function. The Type of Tiger field uses native HTML5 required attribute to make sure that it's required if shown. All fields are controlled components.

## Accessiblilty

- High contrast between background and white text
- Bright blue button against dark grey background
- I've tested using the form with tab button for those that don't have the motor functions to use a mouse and can complete form with only keyboard

## Browser Support

Create-React-App comes out of the box with browserlist configuration in the package.json. I've chosen to stick with default values.

## Progressive Enhancement & Testing

I was not able to incorporate these aspects in the test due to the 2 hour time constraint.

## Documentation

This Readme file is the documentation of my thought process and priorities during the test.
